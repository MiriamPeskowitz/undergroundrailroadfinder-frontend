            <p>
               Free-write about each site, exploring its story and your story of seeing it. Try these prompts to get started: Who are the people in the story? How does this site tell the story of those people? Would you tell it differently? What do the objects left behind make you think and feel? How does this place fit into other places and histories you've seen and know?
