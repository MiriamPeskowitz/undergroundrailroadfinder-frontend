journey, curiosity, about statues, they're so entirely public, they mean a great deal, esp to those who put them up, but often we walk/drive/bike past them and barely notice them. They are often ignored.

What do we make of them, of these images, people from our history, living with us, as it were, taking up their position in our public space. 
I chose these sites and statues because they are about resistance, to finding a bit more space today than one had in the past, to being part of something larger than ourselves, each person a piece of a railroad, a piece of someone else's journey from enslavement to freedom.
